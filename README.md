# inkTober

This is a personal project made with processing (more info at https://processing.org/),

The objective is to participate the traditional InkTober 2019 but in a special way. Since i'm got at coding but not at drawing, for every day of InkTober an art will be made with programming.

Unfortunately moving pixels cannot be draw in paper neither in skin ( at least not yet). So this project is for apreciation only, not applicable (yet) for the traditional InkTober aim: Tatoos.
